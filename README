Description:

Color Factory's background color and decimal/hexadecimal readouts respond as you
drag the sliders to adjust individual RGB color components.

Click in a slider's track and its thumb will jump to the point clicked.

The last slider used is active and can be nudged with the up/down arrow keys.
Click anywhere outside of a slider to deactivate it.

Color Factory uses Cadenza (https://github.com/eightycolumns/cadenza).
